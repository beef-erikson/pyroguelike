# pyroguelike
A playground-in-development to test game ideas, skills, mechanics and so on easily and quickly.

While it's bare-bones at the moment, the skeleton is slowly being built. Run main.py to execute and config.py contains a few items to tweak. Expect daily updates.
## Current Features
- Simple player controls working (WASD, keypad, arrow keys)
- Quit with 'q' or ESC.
- Can spawn in multiple entities with color, see main.py.
