I'm building a playground to test game ideas, skills, mechanics and so on easily and quickly.

Once it's in a more-functional state, I will release this in versions. Currently, I'm working on the framework and hope to push daily updates.

Simply run main.py.
## Current Features
- Simple player controls working (WASD, keypad, arrow keys)
- Quit with 'q' or ESC.
- Can spawn in multiple entities with color
