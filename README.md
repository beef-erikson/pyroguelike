# pyroguelike
A playground-in-development to test game ideas, skills, mechanics and so on easily and quickly.

While it's bare-bones at the moment, the skeleton is slowly being built. Expect daily updates.
1. Most IDE's will do this, but make certain you have the packages listed in requirements.txt.
2. Run main.py to execute the game. 
3. config.py contains a debug property to turn off/on debug messages. width and height will adjust the amount of tiles drawn.
## Current Features
- Simple player controls working (WASD, keypad, arrow keys)
